This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
1.(a)
```{r}
#from:to; from starting value 1 of sequence to end value 2 of the sequence
1:20
```
(b)
```{r}
#from:to generates a sequence from 'from'(20) to 'to'(1) in steps of -1
20:1
```
(c)
```{r}
#create vector from 1 to 20 and then 19 to 1
c(1:20,19:1)
```
(d)
```{r}
#assign vactor value (4,6,3) to the variable tmp using <-
tmp <- c(4,6,3)
```
(e)
```{r}
help(rep)
#rep replicate the values in x. tmp is the vector to be replicated and 10 is the times.
rep(tmp,10)
```
(f)
```{r}
#len = a non-negative integer is the desired length of the output vecotr, that is the vector tmp
rep(tmp,len = 31)
```
(g)
```{r}
#c(10,20,30) means the first value in vector tmp is replicated for 10 times, the second value is replicated for 20 times and the third value is replicated for 30 times.
rep(tmp,c(10,20,30))
```
2.
```{r}
#seq(3,6,0.1) means from the starting value 3 to ending value 6 by increment 0.1. Then assign this sequence to variable tmp. exp computes the exponential function and cos computes cosine function.
tmp <- seq(3,6,by=0.1)
exp(tmp)*cos(tmp)
```
3.(a)
```{r}
#seq(3,36,3) means from the starting value 3 to ending value 36 by increment 3. Then assign this sequence to variable tmp1. seq(1,34,3) means from the starting value 1 to ending value 34 by increment 3. Then assign this sequence to variable tmp2. ^ for exponentiation. 
tmp1 <- seq(3,36,by=3)
tmp2 <- seq(1,34,by=3)
(0.1^tmp1)*(0.2^tmp2)
```
(b)
```{r}
#seq(1,24,1) means from the starting value 1 to ending value 24 by increment 1. Then assign this sequence to variable tmp. ^ for exponentiation. Plug tmp to the function and then get the result.
tmp <- seq(1,25,by=1)
(2^tmp)/tmp
```
4.(a)
```{r}
#10:100 generates a sequence from 10 to 100 step by 1. Then assign this sequence to variable tmp. Sum returns the sum of all the values present in the variable tmp.
tmp <- 10:100
sum(tmp^3+4*tmp^2)
```
(b)
```{r}
#1:25 generates a sequence from 1 to 25 step by 1. Then assign this sequence to variable tmp. Sum returns the sum of all the values present in the variable tmp.
tmp <- 1:25
sum((2^tmp)/tmp + 3^tmp/(tmp^2))
```
5.(a)
```{r}
help(paste)
#paste is used to concatenate vector after converting to charater. Because the arguments are vectors, they are concatenated term-by-term to give a character vector result. The default seperator is one single space.
paste("label",1:30)
```
(b)
```{r}
#The only difference from the last question is the sep="", which means there is no space between the terms.
paste("fn", 1:30,sep="")
```
6.(a)
```{r}
#sample() means to create two vectors of random integers which are chosen with replacement from the integers 0,1,...,999 and boh vectors have length 250. replace=TRUE means the sampling is with replacement.

(b)
```{r}

(c)
```{r}

xVec[-c(249,250)] + 2*xVec[-c(1,250)]-xVec[-c(1,2)]

(d)
```{r}
#A negative number inside [] means the element to leave out of the selection. xVec[-1] means the first element in xVec is left out and xVec[-length(xVec)] means the last element in xVec is left out. Sum returns the sum of all the values present in the vetors.
sum(exp(-xVec[-1])/(xVec[-length(xVec)]+10))

7.(a)

```
(c)
```{r}
#	The question is asked to give values	in	xVec	which	correspond	to	the	values	in	yVec	which	are	>	600. xVec[] returns the values in xVec. [yVec>600] is asked to choose the elements which greater than 600 in yVec.

(d)
```{r}
#abs(x) computes the absolute value of x, sqrt(x) computes the square root of x, and mean(x) computes the arithmetic mean of x.
