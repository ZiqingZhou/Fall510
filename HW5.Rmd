This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#1 extract numeric colume
```{r}
require(ggplot2) #load the package of ggplot2
data(diamonds) #load the specified data sets
new_diamonds <- diamonds[sapply(diamonds,is.numeric)] 
#This line of code is used to extract numeric variables. sapply() is used to return a matrix, each element of which is the result of applying the function inside. is.numeric is the function used to extract the numeric variables in the data sets diamonds.

```

#2 create data frame. 1st column: pair variable; 2nd column: correlation coefficient.
```{r}
head(new_diamonds)#I want to know the names of numeric variables

#I create two sets of strings, and I want to generate the combinations from those two sets.
set1 <- c("carat","depth","table","price","x","y","z")
set2 <- c("carat","depth","table","price","x","y","z")

#Use the outer and paste function together to generate the marrix of possible combinations
a <- outer(set1,set2,paste,sep='-') 
#The outer function is intended to form the outer product. However, it allows a third argument to replace simple multiplication with any function. Here I replace multiplication with string concatenation(paste), and the result is all combinations of strings. sep="-" is used to define a hyphen as the separator between the strings. 

b <- a[!lower.tri(a)] 
#I want all unique pairwise combinations of treatments. I eliminate the duplicates by removing the lower triangle. the lower.tri function indentifies that triangle, so inverting it identifies all elements outside the lower triangle.

col1 <- as.vector(b) 
#The result of outer is a matrix. I want the combinations in a vector instead, so I flatten the matrix using the as.vector function.

col1

d <- cor(new_diamonds)
#new_diamonds is a date frame, then cor(new_diamonds) returns the correlation matrix. By default, cor calculates the Pearson ccorrelation, which assumes that underlying populations are normally distributed.

col2 <- d[!lower.tri(d)] 
#I want all unique pairwise combinations of treatments. I eliminate the duplicates by removing the lower triangle. the lower.tri function indentifies that triangle, so inverting it identifies all elements outside the lower triangle.

col2

dt <- data.frame(col1,col2)
#use funcion data.frame to create data frame, the first colume is col1 which is the pair and the second colume is col2 which is the correlation coefficient.


```

#3 create a scatter plot for every pair of numeric variables (title:correlation coefficients)
```{r}
#line 54 to line 56 is the answer for question 1 and I copy the answer to question 3
require(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)
new_diamonds <- diamonds[sapply(diamonds,is.numeric)]

require(GGally) #load the package called GGally
p <- ggpairs(new_diamonds, 1:7) 
p
#I try to use ggpairs function firstly to make a matrix of plots with a given data set new_diamonds. 1:7 means using the data from colunme 1 to columne 7 in the data set new_diamonds. The result gives the pair matrix plot and also the correlation coeeficient. However, I do not know how to add a titile to each plot containing the coefficient. So I change to the method below.

scatterplots <- par(mfrow=c(3,7))
#A vector of the form c(3, 7) means Subsequent figures will be drawn in an 3-by-7 array on the device by rows. And par() is used to set graphical parameters. The reason for this step is that I want to make sure all the plots can be presented.

x=0 #give the initial value to x

for (i in 1:6)
{
  for (j in (i+1):7)
  {
    x=x+1
    plot(new_diamonds[c(i,j)],main=c(dt[x,2]))
  }
}
#this loop is used to extract two different variables from the data set new_diamonds to be paired and then plot the scatter plot. The reason that i is in 1:6 but j is in (i+1):7 is because I want all the pairs to be unique. main=c(dt[x,2] means the title in each plot is the number in second columne in dt, which are the correlation coeeficients.

par(scatterplots)
#combine all the plots that come from the loop above 
scatterplots

```
